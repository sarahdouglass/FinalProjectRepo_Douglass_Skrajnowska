# GUI Calculator
Calculator displayed and used in the user interface.

## General Overview
Collaborative Repository being used for the EECE 2140 final project 2024. The goal of this project is to create an interactive calculator with ten or more functions that appears in the user interface (GUI). This will be done using Python's built-in functions on top of imported libraries, including, but not limited to, Tkinter, Tkinter.ttk, NumpPy, and Math. When the program is run, a calculator GUI is successfully displayed, and the user can perform a multitude of different calculations and actions (addition, multiplication, trigonometry, delete, clear, and more).
## User Guide
The calculator cannot be installed, but by running the code, the UI will appear. The user is then enabled to perform any of the available functions for all their calculating needs. Numbers and operations can be chosen by either pressing the buttons on the interface or using the keys on their computer as key binds were added for flexibility of use. As long as they comply with the laws of mathematics, each numeric function will work as expected. If they were to enter an error case, such as dividing by zero or trying to take the sin of a negative number, the consequence is the crashing of the code. This will continue to be worked on as the project progresses past the final presentation date. Order of operations is implemented so users can use multiple operations in one run-through without running into logic errors. The calculator can perform multiple calculations in one run just as an actual calculator and has the ability to both delete input and clear the input/output screen for a fresh start when mistakes are made when typing/entering the desired functions and values.
## Github Setup
The GitHub repository was set up and tested to ensure problems would not be run into during the first stages of the project, as represented by the test file and testing commits. Once it was verified that no issues were demonstrated, the main file was added along with the README. Both of which would be continuously updated throughout the course of this assignment. Other files were added as new ideas were tested by both members. These were used to store preliminary ideas without altering the code directly, as sometimes major changes would cause delays in the pushing and pulling chain of command.
## Future Work
Going forward, the goals for further developing this project include customizing the interface with different colors, fonts, and dimensions. Fixing the error cases is the top priority, but formatting is also an important part of any project. Finding a way to use parenthesis in the trigonometric and logarithmic functions to make the program cleaner and more in line with an actual calculator is on the debugging docket as well.
