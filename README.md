# FinalProjectRepo_Douglass_Skrajnowska
Collaborative Repository being used for the EECE 2140 final project 2024. The goal of this project is to create an interactive calculator with ten or more functions that appears in the user interface (GUI). This will be done using Python's built-in functions on top of imported libraries, including, but not limited to, tkinter, tkinter.ttk, and pandas. The installation and running of the project will be detailed later as more aspects are developed, mainly the user interface and graphics implementations. Graphics are still in development. When the program is run, a GUI of a calculator is successfully displayed. The next steps are to connect the buttons with the desired class methods and enable the user to be able to use the keyboard to import information in addition to simply clicking the buttons. This will be further elaborated on as the project progresses and a better understanding of the impact of the graphics libraries is known. If this is all accomplished with time to spare, a history button allowing the user to look back on previous calculations will be added. If this task is also completed in a timely manner, there is a possibility some implementation of graphing could be appended.
